For those readers not familiar with the minutiae of Italian geography, Basilicata is the instep of the Italian ‘boot’, one of the regions of the so-called ‘Mezzogiorno’, synonymous with the poorer southern half of the peninsula.
ENI (Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi) the Italian Hydrocarbons Authority is an Italian energy company and one of Europe’s largest in terms of sales. Established in 1953, Eni operates primarily in petroleum, natural gas, and petrochemicals. In 1991 Eni and Basilicata made news headlines in the same breath when the Val d’Agri onshore oilfield was discovered in the agricultual, unspoiled valley of the Agri river that, for much of its journey, forms the border between Potenza and Matera provinces. It turned out to be the largest onshore hydrocarbon field in Europe.
